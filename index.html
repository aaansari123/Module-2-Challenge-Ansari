            <p>Hi! My name is Asad Ansari. I am currently 24 years old and live in Upper Darby, PA. I graduated from Drexel in 2019 with a degree in math and philosophy. After that I went to law school and completed my first two years of law school at Temple Law. Currently I am on a leave of absence from law school and am exploring a career shift into the sofware field!</p>
